# openInjMoldSim [`v1.1.2`](VERSION.md)

This is an [OpenFOAM 3.0.1](http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation) solver for simulation of injection molding filling, packing and cooling stages.
It is a modification of the compressibleInterFoam solver distributed with OpenFOAM.
The solver has so far been validated on the [2D demo](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krebeljk/openInjMoldSim/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorials.ipynb) case for amorphous polystyrene.
A simulation of (semi-crystalline) HDPE is under development.
Currently, the simulation is prohibitively inconvenient for typical industrial use.

See the [tutorials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/krebeljk/openInjMoldSim/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorials.ipynb) for more info.

This solver built for OpenFOAM but is not part of OpenFOAM. Regarding OpenFOAM, see the official website [openfoam.org](https://openfoam.org/), unofficial wiki
[openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page) and the community forum

## Getting Started

An [OpenFOAM 3.0.1 installation](http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation) is required to run the code. This code was run on Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Centos 6.6 (Rocks 6.2 Sidewinder).

Run `Allwmake` in the solver directory to compile the solver.

Run `AllRun` in the [`fill_pack`](/tutorials/demo/fill_pack) directory to run the example simulation. Then run `paraFoam` in the case directory to view the results.

## Functionality

* Compressible, non-isothermal, laminar cavity flow.
* Tait equation of state.
* Cross-WLF viscosity model.
* Specific heat and thermal conductivity may depend on temperature and pressure (tabular form).
* Elastic stress in the solid phase.

## Feedback

Any feedback is apreciated - krebeljk()gmail.com.
