# fill\_pack

Experimental pressure evolution is imposed at one end of the cavity. This causes the cavity to fill. Air is allowed to
exit the cavity via boundary conditions. When the cavity is filled with the polymer (polystyrene) the outlet is closed to
simulate packing. Two cavity positions are probed for pressure. The evolutions are compared to experimental values by
running the AllPlot script.

Run the script ./Residuals during the calculation to plot the convergence behavior (gnuplot 5 or higher required).
